**This repository is based on content from book "Generative Deep Learning by David Foster". Though the book implements all the generative 
models in Keras, i've tried my best to build it in pytorch.**

The books consists of multiple parts

* Part I - What are generative model and its types & implementation ?

### **Objective - Learning by Doing**

* Implementation of Autoencoder
* Implementation of Variational Autoencoder
* Implementation of GAN (DCGAN)
* Implementation of WGAN
* Implementation of WGAN-GP

* Part II - Variant of GAN and its application in other domain like text, audio.

**Note** Notebooks will be shared soon.
