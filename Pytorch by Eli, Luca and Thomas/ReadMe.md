The Lesson in this notebooks are taught by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, AND Thomas Viehmann from book **"Deep Learning with PyTorch"**. 

The book contains both the theory and implementation of Deep Learning Models.

**Notebook I**

* How to train a pretrained model in Pytorch
* How to work with pytorch like tensor, numpy to tensor, named tensor, storage in pytorch etc.
* How to implement One-hot encoding in Pytorch.
* How to handle Time series data in Pytorch
* How to handle Images in Pytorch, changing dimension as required in pytorch module.
* How to perform Word to Index conversion
* How to split data between train and validation
* How to build model in Pytorch
* How to find derivative in pytorch
* How to move from training mode to evaluation mode
* How to train a network with help of Optimizer and Criterion (Loss Function).
