### Things you will learn

* Basic of Pytorch
* Creating standard project using Pytorch for both NLP and CV tasks via torchtext and torchvision
* Implementing Image Classification using Pytorch from Scratch
* Loading and preprocessing Textdata in torchtext
* Using Pretrained Word Embedding in torchtext
* DataLoaders
* Transforms in torchvision
* zero_grad()
* optimizer.backward()
* How parameters i.e. coefficients of a neural network is initialized
* Training GANs Network.
* Saving and Loading GANs Network for Image Generation.
* optim()
* state_dict() - save the model
* What happens when you don't normalize data
* How to avoid making gradient descent from reaching nan or inf
* difference between save() and state_dict()
