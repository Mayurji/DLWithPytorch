### Deep Learning with Pytorch

**Things you will learn in Notebook **

* How to train a pretrained model in Pytorch
* How to work with pytorch like tensor, numpy to tensor, named tensor, storage in pytorch etc.
* How to implement One-hot encoding in Pytorch.
* How to handle Time series data in Pytorch
* How to handle Images in Pytorch, changing dimension as required in pytorch module.
* How to perform Word to Index conversion
* How to split data between train and validation
* How to build model in Pytorch
* How to find derivative in pytorch
* How to move from training mode to evaluation mode
* How to train a network with help of Optimizer and Criterion (Loss Function).
* Creating standard project using Pytorch for both NLP and CV tasks via torchtext and torchvision
* Implementing Image Classification using Pytorch from Scratch
* Loading and preprocessing Textdata in torchtext
* Using Pretrained Word Embedding in torchtext
* DataLoaders
* Transforms in torchvision
